Installation Guide:

Theres two ways to download, download the mods and put it in your instance (which should be 1.20.1 and forge 47.4.6) 
or use github launcher to do so.

Make the instance via whatever modded minecraft launcher you are using, choosing version 1.20.1 and forge 47.4.6.
Allocate at least 8 gigs. 10gb recommended, honestly.

Find the way to view the instance files for the one you just made, and add the mods folder (what you downloaded here, from me!) to this one. 

Start up the instance! Find your server link, play single-player, or host your own. I don't mind.
